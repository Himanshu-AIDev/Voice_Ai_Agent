He completed his MBBCh from Cairo University and his MD from Cairo University, both in Cairo, Egypt. He holds a Fellowship from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (FRCS), Glasgow.\nUpdated On:January 30, 2025\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nMacular degeneration is characterized by an eye condition that impairs central vision. The macula, or core of the retina, is impacted by macular degeneration. Central vision is governed by the retina, which is located at the rear of the eye. Macular degeneration patients do not experience total blindness. Their capacity to see objects in the periphery is unimpaired. The majority of cases of this prevalent age-related eye disease affect adults over 50.\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nA hereditary eye condition may be macular degeneration. However, it can also strike those who have never had the illness in their family. When the macula at the back of your eye begins to deteriorate for no apparent cause, it is known as macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration is correlated with advancing age.\nMacular degeneration unrelated to aging may be linked to\nA diet deficient in essential nutrients\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nYour eye's macula aids in the transmission of pictures from the optic nerve to the brain. Your brain is unable to interpret or decipher the pictures that your eyes perceive if you have macula damage. A large number of macular degeneration patients have no symptoms at first until the condition worsens. You could encounter:\nHaving worse vision in dimly lit areas\nIssues or modifications to your colour perception\nStraight lines that appear to be wavy or curved\nAreas that are black or blank in your field of view\nWhen to see a doctor for\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nIt is always best that you perform routine eye-checks at your doctor. Consult your doctor immediately if you experience any of the symptoms associated with age-related macular degeneration.\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nThe phrase \"age-related macular degeneration\" (AMD) refers to the increased risk of macular degeneration with aging. However, several circumstances can cause macular degeneration to manifest in people at earlier ages.\nAge is not the only risk factor for macular degeneration; other considerations include\nhaving a history of macular degeneration in your family\nhaving a weight problem\nhaving hypertension, or elevated blood pressure\neating a lot of fat, especially saturated fat\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nIt might be difficult to do several tasks if you lose your center vision. The degree of your visual impairment may prevent you from being able to read proficiently, identify faces, move, cook, and make repairs around the house. You might also become blind if you have severe AMD. Anxiety and despair might result from changes in your way of living. Visual hallucinations are a symptom of Charles Bonnet syndrome, which is experienced by certain AMD patients.\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nAnnual eye exams are crucial since macular degeneration seldom exhibits symptoms in its early stages. They will assist your doctor in identifying the illness early and initiating therapy. Your eye doctor examines your retina and macula to look for any abnormalities during an examination. Your doctor could request one or more of the following tests:\nThe Amsler grid is a test that consists of a straight-line grid with a large dot in the middle. You can be asked to point out grid lines or areas that appear wavy, fuzzy, or broken by your healthcare practitioner. Significant distortion might be a sign of advanced macular degeneration or a sign that the condition is growing worse. This is something you may use at home to keep an eye on your symptoms and detect any changes.\nAfter administering drops to dilate your eyes, your healthcare professional will use a special lens to examine the interior of your eyes.\nFluorescein angiography:\nA yellow injected into a vein in your arm is followed by a specialized camera as it passes through the blood vessels in your eye. Any leaking under your macula may be seen.\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT):\nThis imaging device captures finely detailed pictures of your retina and macula, which are located at the rear of your eye. Neither invasive nor uncomfortable is optical coherence tomography. All you have to do is stare into a lens as the device snaps images.\nOptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA):\nThis diagnostic technique makes use of the OCT scanning instrument and laser light reflection rather than fluorescein dye. It creates three-dimensional pictures of the blood flow via your eye in a matter of seconds.\nBook an appointment with a Medcare specialist in a minute\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nThe macular degeneration has no known treatment. Early therapy initiation can lessen the severity of symptoms and reduce the disease's course. Despite effective therapy, problems frequently recur. Treatments include nutritional supplements, prescription drugs, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and laser therapy, depending on the kind of degeneration.\nPhotodynamic Therapy (PDT)\nYour eye care professional will employ photodynamic therapy (PDT) to remove excess blood vessels in your eye by injecting a light-sensitive medication and using a laser. Your doctor may administer anti-VEGF injections in addition to PDT.\nLaser Photocoagulation\nIn the course of treating wet age-related macular degeneration with laser photocoagulation, your doctor will seal and kill the leaky blood vessels using a laser. In actuality, this was the first wet AMD therapy. Because of the advent of anti-VEGF injections, providers are using PDT and laser photocoagulation less frequently than they once did.\nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\nTo reduce your risk of macular degeneration, you can do the following:\nKeep yourself at a healthy weight\nContinue to be active\nSustain appropriate cholesterol and blood pressure levels\nLim, L.
