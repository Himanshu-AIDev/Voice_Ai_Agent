He completed his MBBS and MS in General Surgery from Calicut University in India followed by an MCh in Neurosurgery from Kerala University of Health and Applied Sciences also in India. He holds a Fellowship in Advanced Spine Surgery from Amrita Institute of Medical Science & Research Centre, India.\nUpdated On:January 30, 2025\nA cell growth inside or close to the brain is called a brain tumour. Brain tissue can develop brain tumours. Brain tumours may also occur close to brain tissue. Neural pathways, the pituitary, pineal, and brain surface membranes are all near one another.\nBrain tissue can give rise to brain tumours. We refer to these as primary brain tumours. Cancer can occasionally go from other regions of the body to the brain. These tumours are known as metastatic brain tumours or secondary brain tumours.\nBrain tumour types include:\nBrain tumours associated with gliomas:\u00a0 Cell growths that resemble glial cells are known as gliomas. In the brain tissue, glial cells encircle and support nerve cells. Astrocytomas, glioblastomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas are among the several forms of gliomas and associated brain cancers. Although they can be benign, most gliomas are malignant. The most prevalent kind of malignant brain tumour is glioblastoma.\nMalignancies of the choroid plexus: Tumours of the choroid plexus originate from cells that produce the fluid that envelops the brain and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid is the term for this fluid. The brain's ventricles, which are fluid-filled chambers, are home to choroid plexus tumours. Tumours of the choroid plexus may be benign or malignant. The malignant variation of this kind of brain tumour is called choroid plexus carcinoma.\nThe germ cells that develop into the sperm and egg cells are the precursors of germ cell cancers. The testicles and ovaries contain the majority of germ cells. However, they can occasionally be found in other bodily areas, such as the brain. Brain germ cell tumours are frequently found near the pituitary or pineal glands. Most germ-cell cancers are not harmful. Children are more likely to have them.\nCells left over during prenatal development give rise to embryonal malignancies. The cells, known as embryonal cells, remain in the brain beyond birth. Malignant brain tumours called embryonal tumours are more common in infants and early childhoods. Medulloblastoma is the most typical kind of embryonal tumour. Usually found in the cerebellum, a brain region in the lower back.\nPineal tumours originate in and around the pineal gland in the brain. The brain's center is home to the pineal gland. It produces the hormone melatonin, which promotes restful sleep. Pineal tumours may be cancerous or benign. The most frequent kind of malignant pineal tumour in children is called pineoblastoma.\nBrain tumours known as meningiomas originate in the membranes enveloping the brain and spinal cord. Although meningiomas are mostly benign, malignant ones can occasionally occur. The most prevalent kind of benign brain tumour is a meningioma.\nGrowths in and around nerves are called nerve tumours. The most frequent kind that occurs in the head is known as schwannoma or acoustic neuroma. The primary nerve that links the brain and inner ear is where this benign tumour is situated.\nPituitary tumours can start in the area around the gland. This little gland can be found close to the brain's base. The majority of tumours that develop in or near the pituitary gland are benign. The pituitary gland itself is the site of pituitary tumours. One kind of brain tumour that develops close to the pituitary gland is called a craniopharyngioma.\nRare cancers of many other kinds can occur in and around the brain. Muscles, blood arteries, and connective tissue surrounding the brain can all become the site of a tumour. The skull's bones are prone to tumour formation. The immune system cells in the brain that fight germs can give rise to malignant brain tumours. We refer to this particular form of brain cancer as primary central nervous system lymphoma.\nPrimary brain tumours are brain tumours that originate from brain tissue. The brain or adjacent tissue may be the site of its initiation. Meninges\u2014the membranes that surround the brain\u2014might be among the nearby tissue. The pineal gland, pituitary, and nerve tumours are other possible sites for brain tumours.\nThe occurrence of genetic alterations in brain cells can lead to brain cancers. What instructions a cell needs to do is encoded in its DNA. The alterations instruct the cells to proliferate rapidly and to live on when healthy cells would normally die off throughout their regular life cycle. In the brain, this produces a large number of additional cells. Tumours are growths that are formed by cells.\nWhy certain DNA alterations result in brain tumours is unknown. The etiology of brain tumours is often unknown for many patients. Parents can occasionally give their kids genetic variations. The alterations may make a brain tumour more likely. Rarely do hereditary brain tumours occur. Discuss with your healthcare practitioner any family history of brain tumours. If you want to know if developing a brain tumour is more likely in your family, you should consult with a physician who specializes in genetics.\nPrimary brain tumours are more common in children with brain tumours. The most common cause of brain tumours in adults is cancer that metastasizes to the brain from another location.\nCancer that begins outside the brain and spreads there might result in secondary brain tumours. Metastatic cancer is the term for cancer that spreads. Although any cancer can travel to the brain, the following are prevalent types:\ncarcinoma of the breast\ncarcinoma of the colon\ncarcinoma of the kidneys\ncarcinoma of the lung\nWhy certain cancers are more prone to spread to other locations than others and why some only spread to the brain is unknown.\nThose with a prior history of cancer are more likely to develop secondary brain tumours. In rare cases, a brain tumour might be the initial indication of cancer that started in another part of the body.\nCompared to primary brain tumours, secondary brain tumours are significantly more prevalent in adults.\nThe size and location of a brain tumour determine its indications and symptoms. Tumour grade, another term for the rate at which the brain tumour is developing, may also have an impact on symptoms.\nThe following are some common indications and symptoms of brain tumours:\nHead pressure or headache that is worse first thing in the morning\nHeadaches that appear worse and occur more frequently\nHeadaches that are occasionally referred to as migraines or tension headaches\nEye problems, including double vision, fuzzy vision, and vision loss on the sides of your field of vision\nLosing the ability to move or feel in one arm or leg\nHaving trouble staying balanced\nUncertainty in routine affairs\nHaving problems adhering to basic instructions\nA shift in conduct or personality\nEpisodes, particularly in the absence of prior seizure history\nVertigo is another name for dizziness or the sensation that the world is spinning\nExperiencing extreme hunger and weight gain\nThe symptoms of non-cancerous brain tumours usually appear gradually. Benign brain tumours are another name for noncancerous brain tumours. They may produce mild symptoms that take some time to manifest. Over months or years, the symptoms may worsen.\nThe symptoms of cancerous brain tumours worsen rapidly. Malignant or brain malignancies are other names for cancerous brain tumours. They produce symptoms that appear out of the blue. In a couple of days or weeks, they worsen.\nWhen to see a doctor for\nThere are situations where brain tumours resemble the signs of a stroke, such as abnormalities in speech, vision, balance, or cognition. A clue that something is off can include weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, personality changes, or an overall feeling of disorientation. Also, get routine check-ups if you are at high risk of developing brain tumours.\nThe etiology of primary brain tumours is unknown in the majority of cases. Doctors have, however, discovered a few variables that might increase the risk. Among the risk factors are: Radiation exposure, age, and syndromes inherited from parents that raise the chance of brain tumours\nIndividuals suffering from brain tumours encounter cognitive, emotional, and physical problems. Headaches, dysphagia, and seizures are often experienced side effects of brain tumours.\nShould your physician suspect you may have a brain tumour, you will require many tests and procedures to confirm the diagnosis. These might consist of:\nA neurological examination. A neurological examination measures the function of several brain regions. Your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength, and reflexes may all be tested during this examination. Your healthcare professional can use this information if you are experiencing difficulties in one or more categories. A brain tumour cannot be found by a neurological examination. However, it assists your physician in determining which area of your brain may be problematic.\nBrain CT scan. X-rays are used in computed tomography scans, or CT scans, to create images. It's readily accessible and yields fast results. Therefore, if you experience headaches or other symptoms that might have a wide range of causes, a CT scan could be the initial imaging test that is performed. You can find issues in and around your brain using a CT scan. Your doctor might use the results to guide his or her decision on the next test to order. You may require a brain MRI if your physician believes that your CT scan indicates a brain tumour.\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging. Strong magnets are used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to provide images of the inside of the body. Since MRI provides a clearer image of the brain than other imaging procedures, it is frequently used to identify brain cancers. Before an MRI, a dye is frequently injected into an arm vein. The dye produces more vivid images. Smaller tumours are easier to notice as a result. It can assist your medical team in distinguishing between healthy brain tissue and a brain tumour.\nIn the lab, testing the tissue sample. A lab receives the biopsy sample to be tested. Tests can determine whether or not the cells are malignant. Your healthcare staff can determine the rate of cell growth by looking at the cells under a microscope. What DNA alterations are present in the cells can be determined by other testing. This aids in the creation of your treatment plan by your medical team.\nGetting a tissue sample collected. A brain biopsy involves taking a sample of brain tumour tissue so that it may be examined in a lab. A surgeon often obtains the sample when performing brain tumour excision surgery. In the event that surgery is not an option, a needle may be used to take a sample. Stereotactic needle biopsy is the process used to remove a sample of brain tumour tissue using a needle.\nBrain PET scan. Certain brain malignancies can be found with a positron emission tomography scan, or PET scan. An injection of radioactive tracer into a vein is used in PET scans. After passing through the blood, the tracer binds to the cells of brain tumours. The PET machine's photos of the tumour cells are enhanced by the tracer. Quickly proliferating and growing cells will absorb more of the tracer. Brain tumours that are developing fast may be best detected with a PET scan.\nBook an appointment with a Medcare specialist in a minute\nThe course of treatment for a brain tumour is contingent upon the diagnosis of either a benign or malignant brain tumour. Treatment choices are also influenced by the brain tumour's location, size, grade, and kind. Radiation treatment, radiosurgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and surgery are possible options. Your healthcare team takes into account both your preferences and general health when deciding on a course of therapy.\nThere may not be an immediate need for treatment. If the tumour in your brain is tiny, noncancerous, and symptomless, you may not require immediate treatment. Benign brain tumours that are small may never develop at all, or they may grow so slowly that they never cause any issues. To monitor the progression of brain tumours, you may have brain MRI scans many times a year. You may require therapy if the brain tumour develops more quickly than anticipated or if you have symptoms.\nRemoving every tumour cell from the brain is the aim of surgery. However, complete removal of the tumour is not always possible. As much of the brain tumour as is safely removed is the surgeon's goal when it comes to surgery. Benign and malignant brain tumours can both be treated with brain tumour removal surgery.\nCertain brain tumours are tiny and can be easily removed from the surrounding brain tissue. This increases the likelihood of a full removal of the tumour. It is impossible to isolate other brain tumours from the surrounding tissue. A brain tumour may occasionally be located close to a crucial brain region. This can be a dangerous circumstance for surgery. The surgeon may remove the tumour to the greatest extent that is safe. Sometimes, a brain tumour's partial removal is referred to as a subtotal resection.\nThe doctor applies external beam radiation to your complete brain or only the part of it where the tumour is located. Radiation therapy is often directed toward the surrounding tissue in patients who have brain tumours. Radiation therapy to the entire brain may be necessary if there are several tumours. It is referred to as whole-brain radiation therapy when the entire brain is treated. The most common purpose for whole-brain radiation therapy is the treatment of cancer that metastasizes from another region of the body to the brain, resulting in numerous brain tumours.\nFor brain malignancies, stereotactic radiosurgery is a highly intensive radiation therapy. It directs radiation beams to the brain tumour at various angles. Not every beam has much power. However, a massive radiation dosage at the intersection of the beams destroys the tumour cells. Benign brain tumours and brain malignancies can both be treated with radiosurgery.\nTo destroy tumour cells, powerful medications are used in chemotherapy for brain tumours. Chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously or as pills. During surgery, the chemotherapy drug may occasionally go into the brain tissue. Benign brain tumours and brain malignancies can also be treated with chemotherapy. It is sometimes administered along with radiation treatment. Chemotherapy side effects vary depending on the medication type and dosage. Hair loss, nausea, and vomiting are side effects of chemotherapy.\nMedication designed to target certain compounds found in brain tumour cells is known as targeted treatment. Trained therapies have the ability to kill tumour cells by obstructing these substances.\nFor some forms of benign brain tumours and brain malignancies, targeted treatment medications are accessible. It may be necessary to examine the cells in your brain tumour to see whether you may benefit from targeted therapy.\nIt is not possible to avoid brain tumours. People who are more likely to develop a brain tumour may want to think about being tested. Brain tumours cannot be prevented by screening. However, brain tumours are more likely to be successfully treated when discovered early on, so screening may be helpful.\nDiscuss with your healthcare practitioner any family history of brain tumours or genetic disorders that raise the risk of brain tumours. You may want to consult with a genetic counselor or other medical professional with training in genetics. A professional can assist you in managing your risk and understanding it.\nMcFaline-Figueroa, J. R., & Lee, E. Q. (2018). Brain tumors.\nThe American journal of medicine\nNadeem, M. W., Ghamdi, M. A.
